Use a non-default, perceptually uniform sequential colormap and set the color range mapped to the whole range of potential values of the average popularity (0-100). Visualize the same hierarchy tree as a node-link diagram with node size proportional to the number of items, the color proportional to the average popularity\n",

The apps should show with the selected chart type the tree representation of the hierarchy: all->genres->subgenres"
